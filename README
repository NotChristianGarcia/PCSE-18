1 - Lecture 1, Exercise 1:
Anything outputted from code is duplicated by the number of task being used. This is because MPI works by
using all cores and then the user specifying which cores do what. If all cores run the code then the code
would then "multiply" by the number of cores.

2 - Lecture 1, Exercise 3:
No write up neccessary.

3 - Lecture 2, Simple Ping Pong:
No write up neccessary.

4 - Lecture 3/4, Experiment #2:
No write up neccessary.

5 - Lecture 3/4, Experiment #3:
No write up neccessary.

6 - Lecture 4, In Class Lab #1:
You would use MPI_MAX collective when using the MPI_Reduce function, this would give you the maximum value
of all the values that are collected.

7 - Lecture 9, Monte Carlo:
No write up neccessary.

8 - Lecture 9, Trapezoidal Rule:
